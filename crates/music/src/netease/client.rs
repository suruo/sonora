//! NetEase data access, over the endpoints the site's own web player calls.
//!
//! None of this is an official api — NetEase publishes none — so every path here is one the
//! site's pages or its desktop client use, called with the `MUSIC_U` cookie a browser holds.
//! The catalog answers without an account; everything scoped to the listener, the likes and
//! the playlists and the stream urls, needs one.
//!
//! The site answers HTTP 200 to almost every call, whatever went wrong, and puts the reason in
//! the json `code`, so `check` is what turns one into an error.
